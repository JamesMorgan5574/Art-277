  <h1>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</h1>
  <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
     feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard down.
     While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected. 
    <br><br>
    Dr. Cardona explains.   
    <br><br>
    “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
    protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
    protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
    exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.” </p>

   <h1>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,<br>
     including other vaccinated people?</h1>
     <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds<br>
        that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.<br>
         <br><br>
        “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may<br>
        not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data<br>
        and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”</p>
